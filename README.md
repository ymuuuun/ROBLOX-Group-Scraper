# ROBLOX-Group-Scraper

A basic python program that looks for ownerless and joinable ROBLOX groups in a range.

Heavily inspired by TechTator's group scraper, check it out! 
https://github.com/TechTator/roblox-group-scraper

This is entirely open-source, contributions are highly appreciated to make this run at its best.

## Output
- Once it finds an ownerless and joinable group, it will print the groups information in green text, and open your browser with the groups url

## Things you can currently do
- You can set the ID for when to start and when to end the search.
- You can use proxies (For preventing request blocks)

## Plans 
- Adding an option to choose a completely random number instead of looking through a range for groups IDs (this might require this entire project to be rewritten)
- Make using proxies easier
- Reducing the amount of packages required to use the program

## Usage
To use this, you need the following packages
- colorama https://pypi.org/project/colorama/
- winotify https://pypi.org/project/winotify/

To use proxies, add your proxies address and port number in the Proxies.txt file in the format below.
