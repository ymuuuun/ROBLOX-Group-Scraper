# ROBLOX-Group-Scraper

A basic python script that looks for empty and joinable ROBLOX groups in a range.

Heavily inspired by h0nda1337's group scraper.

This is entirely open-source, contributions are highly appreciated to make this run at its best.

## Things you can currently do
- You can set the ID for when to start and when to end.
- You can use proxies (For preventing request blocks)

## Plans 
- Adding an option to choose a completely random number instead of looking through a range for groups IDs (this might require this entire project to be rewritten)

## Screenshots (more are coming dw)
