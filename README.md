# ROBLOX-Group-Scraper

A basic python program that looks for ownerless and joinable ROBLOX groups in a range.

Heavily inspired by TechTator's group scraper, check it out! 
https://github.com/TechTator/roblox-group-scraper

This is entirely open-source, contributions are highly appreciated to make this run at its best.

## Output
- Once it finds an ownerless and joinable group, it will print the groups information in green text, open your browser with the groups url, and save the group url in the Groups.txt file.

## Things you can currently do
- You can set the ID for when to start and when to end the search.
- You can use proxies (For preventing request blocks)

## Plans 
- Adding an option to choose a completely random number instead of looking through a range for groups IDs (this might require this entire project to be rewritten)

## Usage
To use this, you need the following packages
- colorama https://pypi.org/project/colorama/
- winotify https://pypi.org/project/winotify/

To use proxies, add your proxies address and port number in the Proxies.txt file in the format below.
